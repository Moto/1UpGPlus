1-Up for Google+ Chrome Extension

Blip.Fm stuff will be removed from my fork, only plan to support and code Google+ 1-up.
Better support for Google+ along with finding out and fixing the sound dying bug will be fixed.
Options page to be designed a tad more sexy, more eye candy if you will.
New features will not be added until it's 100% working great on Google+, new mushroom images could be added!
